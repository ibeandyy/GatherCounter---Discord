# GatherCounter---Discord
Monitor's Gather.Town's active player count for ConcaveTown and modifies a channel name accordingly.

Bot takes your discord server's Guild ID, the channel ID whose name will be changed to reflect your online user count, and a discord token, gather token, and gather StoreID.

You'll need to create a config.json in the same directory with  StoreID, discordToken, gatherAPI, guildID, and channelID keys.

Afterwards, just run npm init and you should be good to go.
